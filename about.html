            Hi, I'm Nikhil Sharma, Have a diverse academic background that has
            shaped my skills and aspirations. After completing my senior
            secondary education at Little Flowers Public School in 2019, I
            pursued my graduation from Delhi University, earning my degree in
            2023. Alongside my formal education, I developed a passion for
            languages and earned a diploma in Spanish from the prestigious
            Jawaharlal Nehru Language Academy. This blend of academic excellence
            and linguistic proficiency has equipped me with a unique
            perspective, fostering both analytical and creative thinking.

            In my professional journey, I've gained over 2 years of experience
            in operations and data analysis. I started my career as an Executive
            in IELTS Pre & Post Operations at IDP Education, where I was
            responsible for managing test results, ensuring data security, and
            handling confidential materials. Most recently, I worked as an
            Associate Analyst at Global Logic until August 27, 2024, where I
            contributed to Amazon's image captioning team, analyzing data,
            managing data flow, and ensuring the accuracy of responses to
            improve accessibility. These experiences have honed my
            problem-solving skills and reinforced my ability to manage complex
            tasks with precision and efficiency.

            My journey into JavaScript began with a desire to dive deeper into
            web development and build dynamic, interactive web applications.
            With a background in data analysis and operations, I quickly
            realized the potential of JavaScript in transforming static websites
            into engaging and user-friendly experiences. I started learning
            JavaScript through online resources and hands-on projects, gradually
            enhancing my skills in front-end development. Over time, I've become
            proficient in key frameworks and libraries, and I'm excited to
            continue refining my skills in JavaScript to create innovative
            solutions that drive meaningful user interactions. My passion for
            coding is fueled by a continuous desire to learn and explore new
            technologies, and I am committed to staying updated with the
            ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem.
